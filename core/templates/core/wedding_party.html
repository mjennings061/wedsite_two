                            the egg battling it out for survival. We shared the womb for a solid 9 months so I guess
                            you could say I‚Äôm pretty attached to her apart from that 12 minutes of freedom I got
                            before she entered the world. I am so upset that Michael has came along and cut off my
                            spare arm‚Ä¶ she will be deeply missed.  I have a BSC in Health and Social Care Policy;
                            however I still vibe in Tesco being a key-worker making sure the nation gets their bread
                            and all that.   Thanks for coming to my ted talk :)
